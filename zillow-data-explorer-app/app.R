I share this interest with both of my parents, who, in addition to being attorneys, manage various properties in the Los Angeles and Orange County areas in order to generate additional income.  Both my parents and I tend to be more Redfin users than Zillow ones, and I wondered why.  I explored what kinds of data visualizations Redfin offers its consumers and found that it has something called "Redfin Data Center," which includes interactive graphs that plot metrics like median sale price, home sales, price per square foot, and more.  These graphs can be customized to show trends from the zip code level to the national one, to show trends for different types of homes, to show month over month or year over year trends, and to show trends for specified periods of time.  I then went to Zillow\'s equivalent or competing data center, "Zillow Research," to see whether or not Zillow is providing its consumers with the same kinds of accessible, informative, and interactive data visualizations.  Zillow has a plethora of data available for the public to download (indeed even more than Redfin has) in its "Data" tab as well as some static graphics in its "Visuals" tab.  It has a few interactive data tables in its "Markets" tab, some of which include lines showing overall trends, but their interactivity is very limited.  You can reorder the rows of the data tables, hover over the lines for temporal and numerical information for those data tables that have lines, and search for specific metropolitan areas to see only the rows for those areas, but trends for different areas are difficult to compare.  Because each area exists in its own row separate from the rest, different scales for metrics like Zillow Home Value Index are indistinguishable from one another.  Both New York and Philadelphia appear to follow the exact same trend even though New Yorkâ€™s Zillow Home Value Index is almost twice that of Philadelphia.  The only metrics included are population, Zillow Home Value Index, Zillow Rent Index, for-sale inventory, and negative equity.  You cannot customize these data tables to see trends at any level other than the metropolitan and national ones, and nowhere to be found are graphics for other metrics like value per square foot.  This absence of up-to-date, visualized, and interactive data is a major shortcoming of Zillow\'s: raw data is accessible only to those who have the tools to understand and synthesize it into something comprehensible, a story; to those who do not, raw data is rather useless, even alienating.  I created this app with the intention of marketing it to Zillow so that it can better match up against its major competition, Redfin.  Zillow is behind the curve in its consumer-facing data visualizations, crippling it as a go-to source of real estate information.  I hope to help to launch Zillow into the future of data visualization with this app.'

These maps can show values at both the county and state levels.  The second tab hosts two graphs for visualizing the data.  The first of these graphs again shows historical trends.
